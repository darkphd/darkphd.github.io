<ul>
  <li> Work on supertask instead of small/fake/intermediate tasks. For example, DUST3R, GPT4, etc.</li>
  <li> When a task is important enough, try to build a so-called foundation model that has scalable training -- using large-scale free unlabeled data. </li>
  <li> Mid-level vs High-level vision tasks. The current best solution to mid-level tasks is (1) pretraining on synthetic data (2) unsupervised training on unlabeled data. The backbone could be pretrained SSL models (e.g. DINO-v2); For high-level vision tasks, SSL+fine-tuning dominates. Mid-level vision has many applications even though high-level vision is the main focus of SSL. </li>
  <li> Industry prefers light-weighted and fast models. Academia cares more about novelty. If a model is not worth working, it is not worth working fast.</li>
  <li> It is so useful to talk to other researchers on topics such as their long-term goals, research agenda, current projects, and thoughts on your projects. People in the same subfield tend to have very similar research idea, which is probably why the community is so competitative and being unique is both hard and highly rewarding. </li>
