    <p> It was a sunny afternoon in 2017 (or 2016). I visited her family in Sichuan. We stayed at her home and tried to have some fun. She proposed to sing a song together and record our voice on an APP that can score our singing. I was so bad at music but she taught me a song sentence by sentence, word by word very patiently. We spent the whole afternoon on Jay Chou's SUNNY DAY (晴天) tirelessly. What a lovely and chill day! </p>

    <p> The SUNNY DAY is not a happy song. Instead, it ends up with "At the end of the story, it seems like you still said GOODBYE" ("故事的最后, 你好像还是说了拜"). I am not a fatalist, but looking back now, this song foreshadowed our ending.</p>

    <p> This is begining of my story. It was probably an ordinary Sichuan-style afternoon, but it is the one afternoon that holds my last impression on my first love. Now in July 2024, we haven't seen each other for 7 years and I can't remember many things clearly. I have to use that afternoon and the song as the anchor to trace back our days.</p>

    <p> The Valentine's Day was probably during my visit. I decided to give her a superise because I had some incomings as a graduate student, not much though (~ 2500 RMB per month) but I can afford some nicer gift beyond cheap silver rings or cartoon watches. I brought her to a Swarovski store in a mall and asked her to pick one item she likes. We both discovered a beautiful bracelet featuring a rotatable heart-shaped crystal stone. I was so hesitant because it costs around 1800 RMB and I have never bought any gifts at that price. She asked the salesperson if the bracelet comes in a smaller size, as the one she tried on looks too big, even though I knew she just wanted to save some money for me T_T. No smaller one, and no other good options, and I decided to buy it for her. (TO BE FINISHED)</p>

    <p> One of the main themes in our six-year relationship might be food, all sorts of classical Sichuan dishes and appetizers, probably it is something we could afford and easily gain some fun. (TO BE FINISHED)</p>
