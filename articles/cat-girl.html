    <h2> Who is she?</h2>
    <p> She is a cat-type girl, 23-year-old, with short black hair, 5'2'' tall, wearing black jeans and casual hoddie, pretty much like the girl showing above. She said YES to all dishes I proposed and she has never explicitly said No. I once asked what gives her hard time, and her answer is what to eat for lunch :). What a cute girl! </p>    
    <p>She shared that as a child, she stood by a Mahjong table, watching her parents play. It seems her childhood wasn't very joyful, which makes me feel sad. I really wish there was something I could do to cheer her up!</p>

    <h2> Why is she cat-type?</h2>
    <p> She is independent, sensitive, smart, cute, pretty, and observant. I have a really hard time to understand her feeling about me. Does she like me? Probably not much but at least she does not hate me :). What does she really like? How can I approach her properly? Why does she reply my message sooo slowly? How to connect with her emotionally? These are basically all questions I want to ask a cat.</p>    

    <h2> What do I want to do with her in our next meeting?</h2>
    <p> Yes, I won't call it a date, as I don't think she would take it in that way. She is probably too nice to say NO to my invitation. Anyway, I don't care, cuz I love staying with her.</p>
    <p> I will give her the graduation bear with her nickname printed on the right feet, but I'll ask her for a favor in return: pick a cat from <a href="cats.html" style="color:blue" target="_blank">several candidates</a> and propose a name for the cat!! What a genius idea!!</p>

    <h2> I will adopt a cat who is picked and named by a cat-like girl!!</h2>
    <p> This is super exciting for me, though I hope it doesn't come across as creepy to her. I wish for us to maintain a long-term friendship or perhaps something more.</p>

    <h2> After our last meeting in LA</h2>
    <p> I just got home at 1:00 AM on July 6th, feeling a mix of happiness and sadness. I'm exhausted, as I've been waking up around 6:30 AM lately, but I don't want to go to sleep—I'm scared of forgetting any details from our meeting tonight. How is it that she looks so perfect every time I see her? </p>
    <p> We roamed the giant 626 night market, and I always wanted to offer her the best to make her happy. She truly has a carefree attitude. She told me how she could play with a tape measure for half an hour nonstop, which only made me admire her more. The food wasn't particularly exciting, but that didn't matter to me; I just wanted to savor every moment with her by my side. </p>
    <p>After dinner, we went to the cinema to watch a movie. I fought hard to stay awake, trying my best not to doze off. Every time I looked at her, she had her sweet smile and seemed to really enjoy the movie.</p>
    <p> Additionally, my greatest fear materialized — she said she would adopt a black cat and didn’t suggest a name for my future pet. Regardless, I'll probably still adopt a cat to help ease my loneliness. </p>

    <h2> When will we meet next? Or will there be a next time? </h2>
    <p> I can't remember the last time I was this into a girl... probably the day when I met my first love? Honestly, I don't think my feeling was as strong at that time. Is this possibly our last meeting ever? No, I won't let that happen! There must be some solution for this, just like all the challenges I have encountered in my life. Once again, my motto is that with enough effort and time, no problem is unsolvable! </p>
