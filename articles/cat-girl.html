    <h2> Who is she?</h2>
    <p> She is a cat-type girl who is 23 years old, with short black hair, 5'2'' tall, always wearing black jeans and casual hoddie, pretty much like the girl showing above. She said YES to any restaurants I proposed. I once asked what gives her hard time, and her answer is what to eat for lunch :). What a cute girl! </p>    
    <p> She once mentioned she was standing next to a Mahjong table, watching her parents playing Mahjong. She seems not quite happy in her childhood. I feel bad about this :( and wish I could do something to cheer her up!</p>


    <h2> Why is she cat-type?</h2>
    <p> She is independent, sensitive, smart, cute, pretty, and observant. I have a really hard time to understand her feeling about me. Does she like me? Probably not much but at least she does not hate me :). What does she really like? How can I approach her properly? Why does she reply my message sooo slowly? How to connect with her emotionally? These are basically all questions I want to ask a cat.</p>    

    <h2> What do I want to do with her in our next meeting?</h2>
    <p> Yes, I won't call it a dating, because it is more like a meeting or even an interview to me. Anyway, I love staying with her.</p>
    <p> I will give her the graduation bear printed with her nickname, but I'll ask her to give me a favor as a return: pick a cat from several candidates and propose a name for the cat!! What a genius idea!! I will adopt a cat soon!! </p>
