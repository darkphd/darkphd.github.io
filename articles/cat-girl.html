    <h2> Who is she?</h2>
    <p> She is a cat-type girl, 23-year-old, with short black hair, 5'2'' tall, wearing black jeans and casual hoddie, pretty much like the girl showing above. She said YES to all dishes I proposed and she has never explicitly said No. I once asked what gives her hard time, and her answer is what to eat for lunch :). What a cute girl! </p>    
    <p>She shared that as a child, she stood by a Mahjong table, watching her parents play. It seems her childhood wasn't very joyful, which makes me feel sad. I really wish there was something I could do to brighten her spirits!</p>

    <h2> Why is she cat-type?</h2>
    <p> She is independent, sensitive, smart, cute, pretty, and observant. I have a really hard time to understand her feeling about me. Does she like me? Probably not much but at least she does not hate me :). What does she really like? How can I approach her properly? Why does she reply my message sooo slowly? How to connect with her emotionally? These are basically all questions I want to ask a cat.</p>    

    <h2> What do I want to do with her in our next meeting?</h2>
    <p> Yes, I won't call it a dating, as I don't think she would take it in that way. She is probably too nice to say NO to my invitation. Anyway, I don't care, cuz I love staying with her.</p>
    <p> I will give her the graduation bear with her nickname printed on the right feet, but I'll ask her to give me a favor as a return: pick a cat from several candidates and propose a name for the cat!! What a genius idea!!</p>

    <h2> I will adopt a cat whose is picked and named by a cat-like girl!!</h2>
    <p> This sounds so exciting to me, but I wish it does not sound creepy to her. I wish we can keep a long-term friendship or beyond.</p>
