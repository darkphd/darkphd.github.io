  <li> 8:30 AM: Prioritize your day. Make a list of the things you want to accomplish during the day.</li>
  <li> 9 AM: Work on the most difficult item on your to-do list. The morning is when you are most alert and can focus best.</li>
  <li> 10:30 AM: Take a coffee break. Aim for mid morning to optimize productivity. Coffee is most effective between 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. when cortisol (a natural  hormone that regulates energy) levels are lower. </li>

  <li> 5:30 pm - 6:30 pm: Workout: Engage in your chosen exercise (e.g., swimming, gym, yoga). Ensure you finish your workout at least three hours before bedtime to give your body time to cool down and relax.</li>
  <li> 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm: Dinner Preparation and Eating: Prepare a healthy dinner and enjoy it mindfully. Try to avoid heavy, spicy, or caffeinated foods and drinks close to bedtime.</li>
  <li> 8:00 pm - 9:30 pm: Reading and Studying: Allocate time for reading books and computer vision papers. Make sure to use a blue light filter on your devices or read physical books to reduce eye strain.</li>
  <li> 9:30 pm - 10:00 pm: Hobbies: Spend time on your hobbies such as piano, painting, or language learning. These activities can be relaxing and enjoyable, helping you wind down.</li>
  <li> 10:00 pm - 10:30 pm: Relaxation: Engage in a calming activity such as meditation, light stretching, or listening to soothing music. This helps signal to your body that it's time to prepare for sleep.</li>
