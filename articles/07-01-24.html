    <h2> Who is she?</h2>
    <p> She is a cat-type girl who is 23 years old, with short black hair, 5'2'' height, always wearing black jeans and casual hoddie, pretty much like the girl in above images generated by GPT-4. She said YES to any restaurants I proposed. I once asked what gives her hard time, and her answer is what to eat for lunch :). </p>    

    <h2> Why is she a cat-type?</h2>
    <p> She is independent, sensitive, smart, cute, pretty, and observant. I have a really hard time to understand her feeling about me. Does she like me? Probably not that much but does not hate at least. What does she really like? How can I approach her properly? </p>    

    <h2> What do I want to do with her in our next meeting?</h2>
    <p> Yes, I won't call it dating, because I simply feel it more like a meeting or interview. Anyway, I'm still interested in learning more about her.</p>
    <p> I will give her the graduation bear with her nickname, but I'll ask her to give me a favor as a return: pick a cat from several candiates and propose a name for my cat!! What a genius idea!!</p>
